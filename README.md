# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

This exercise is an example back end for an e-commerce site. It uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation

First, download the repo. Open the terminal and make sure you're in the "e-commerce" directory. Type "npm i" to download the dependencies. Then, type "mysql -u root -p" to log into mysql and "SOURCE db/schema.sql;" to create the tables. Exit mysql and type "npm run seeds" to install some sample data to work with. Finally, type "npm start" to start the server. You're now ready to use the app!

## Usage

Use Insomnia to run get, post, put, and delete requests to the database! [Click here for a walkthrough video.](link goes here)
